i’m so happy that we are all here together.
honey, this all looks great. 
Oh thank you. i cooked all day for YOU.
the pasta with the tomato sauce looks delicious.  
i know it’s your favorite!  
yum! it’s my favorite too. It’s smell so good, right daddy?
Yes, pumpkin, c’mon lets dig in.
so honey, how was your day?
it was fabulous. i was thinking about the other day. (pause). how was yours?
also, fantastic. and it’s getting better -there is no moon tonight.
dad, can you pass me the salt?
sure. here you go. but don’t put so much.
since i was seven i think everything should be tooooooo much! 
i don’t think it will be much longer now.
something is wrong. 
can you stop humming?
i want more salad! 
more salad, please... 
please, can i have more salad? 
here you go, sweetheart. 
so… how was school today kids?
Today was spectacular.
i had the best time! we learned today that clouds are just a combination of water and air, nothing more. 
and if you touch them they disappear. 
that is fascinating. 
i don’t understand how water can stay in the sky and not fall. 
it must be horrible to just be stuck in between. 
i wish i had more room for the grilled potatoes. 
what is a rainbow?
do YOU know pumpkin?
mmmmm....
it’s magic! 
there are no magic. only light and rain. 
it is raining now! 
who wants roasted carrots? they are soooo good! i saw a recipe in the newspaper that i had to try. and i’ll tell you what? it’s divine! 
i cannot refuse that! 
i don’t think it’s the rain.
oh honey, you wouldn’t believe who i saw today! 
who honey?
the neighbor from next door. 
interesting. 
i have something to say to all of you
it might have been a coincidence. 
i don’t like carrots. 
it is late and dark outside. 
i wonder what i will dream today. 
what do you want to dream about?
about all of us together forever. 
i want to dream about us melting in the sun. 
that sounds lovely. 
time is passing so fast.
where are we going?
nowhere. 
i love you dear.
someone called here today. 
who was it?
i wasn’t the one who took the message. 
it was a man in a green suit with a voice of a girl.
oh, ok. 
i almost forgot. it must be the rain.
and now it is getting darker.
i was wondering when mom is going to do that. 
i am not sure. it happened only once. 
and then, there it was. 
i think it was deliciouuuuss. Is it a cake i can smell in the kitchen? 
can we have some?
yes, let end it with a cake. 
next time we should start it with a soup.
