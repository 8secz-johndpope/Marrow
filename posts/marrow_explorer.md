# Developers and Artists: Exploring the latent space of GAN hand in hand

> In January 2020 we finalized the development phase of _Marrow_. In this series of posts, Shirin Anlen and myself are sharing what we have learned during this process. The [first post](https://medium.com/@s.h.i.r.i.n/7f7db708f06d) was about constructing a well-formed dataset, even with little resources. This post is about working with artists when exploring the latent space of GAN

## Myself and Marrow

Marrow is a hands-on research initiative and interactive installation by [Shirin Anlen](https://shirin.works), exploring the possibilities of [mental disorders in machine learning](https://immerse.news/when-machines-look-for-order-in-chaos-198fb222b60a). I have previously worked with Shirin on numerous projects, most notably the VR documentary [_Tzina: Symphony of Longing_](https://tzina.space). In 2018 I joined forces with Shirin once more to preview _Marrow_ as an installation at [IDFA Doclab 2018](https://www.doclab.org/2018/ive-always-been-jealous-of-other-peoples-families/). The prototype was a success, and one year later we went as co-creators to an intensive development phase, produced by the [National Film Board of Canada](https://www.nfb.ca/interactive/marrow/) and [Atlas V](https://atlasv.io/).
